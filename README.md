###Problem Statement
The goal is to deliver valuable insights to AtliQ Grands by analyzing their historical data, helping the organization make informed decisions and optimize future performance.
# Steps
Here are the steps I am going to be taking:
1. **Metric Creation:** I’ll start by developing metrics based on the provided list to help assess and improve AtliQ Grands' performance.
2. **Dashboard Development:** Next, I’ll create a dashboard that aligns with the mock-up we got from stakeholders, ensuring it fits with AtliQ Grands' strategic goals.
3. **Insight Generation:** Finally, I’ll analyze the data to uncover any additional insights beyond the metrics and dashboard. This will give us even more value for their decision-making process.
